    "leftOption": "I back into the narrow tunnel until stone scrapes my shoulders, forcing it to come straight at me. I keep the spear between us and listen to its steps and breath before I strike.",

    "leftOption": "I walk the pens and mark the lowest cracks in the stone. I cut a channel and pull the river through in stages so it washes each stall clean.",

    "leftOption": "I catch her eye and lead her a few steps to the doorway where it’s quieter. I speak close and low, keeping my terms steady.",

    "leftOption": "I hold my stance and use my shield to keep the heads in one line. I cut only when one lunges, hitting the same base again and again.",
    "rightOption": "I stop trying to win with clean cuts: I drive the bleeding stump directly into the mud, stamp wet clay over it and move to the next head before it can rise.",

    "leftOption": "I sink into the reeds and hold my shield over my head until the first storm of feathers passes. I watch their dive pattern through the gaps and rise only when I can move without getting cut apart.",

    "leftOption": "I drop heavy gates to split the pen into lanes so only one mare can reach me at a time. I set ropes on posts and lead them out one by one without stepping into their teeth.",
    "rightOption": "I crack the gate for one head and slip a loop over it, then adjust fast when it jerks or freezes. I keep changing grip and angle in quick bursts, learning what each mare will follow as I pull it out.",

    "leftOption": "I run along the lee side of the ridge where the wind drops and the roar goes dull. I stay on its tracks from that quieter line so I can track it without the roar drowning my senses",
    "rightOption": "I drive into the loudest part of the storm, sprinting through broken branches and sliding snow as the boar smashes ahead. I keep close enough to feel its steps and let the chaos push my pace.",

    "leftOption": "I lock into one steady rhythm—breath, step, spear—and refuse to bite on every fake turn. I keep tightening that same pattern until my aim stays steady under the strain.",
    "rightOption": "I drop the snares and stop chasing her line, cutting across rough ground to meet her on the next bend. I throw out the plan and reshape the chase mid-run the moment her pattern shifts.",

    "leftOption": "I stay just outside the ash and watch how the three heads steal each other’s view. I shift one step at a time to the side they watch least, taking a small opening while staying hidden.",
    "rightOption": "I step into the ash and scrape my boots on purpose so all three heads turn to me. I strike the first head that lunges and shove hard to keep the other two off me.",

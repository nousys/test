    "leftOption": "I retreat into the narrow tunnel until the rock scrapes my shoulders, forcing it to come straight at me. I keep the spear between us and read its footfalls and breath before I commit.",

    "leftOption": "I pace the pens, mark the lowest seams in the stone, and set stakes where the flow should cut. I open the river in controlled breaks and guide the surge with packed earth so it scours each stall in sequence.",

    "leftOption": "I catch Hippolyta’s eye and draw her a few steps toward the doorway where the roar turns muffled. In the cooler shadow, I hold her gaze and lay out my terms in a low, steady voice.",

    "rightOption": "I abandon clean cuts and change the fight: I hook a chain around the thickest neck and wrench the stump down into the mud. I pack it hard with wet clay under my heel and move immediately to the next head before it can break free.",

    "leftOption": "I sink into the reeds and brace my shield above me, letting the first wave of feathers rake harmlessly across bronze. I watch the rhythm of their dives through the gaps and only rise when a lane opens that I can actually hold.",

    "leftOption": "I drop heavy portcullises to split the pen into lanes, forcing each mare to face me alone. I set slip-knots and pulleys on the posts and walk them out one by one without stepping into snapping distance.",
    "rightOption": "I crack the gate just wide enough for one head to push through, then cinch a loop and immediately adjust when it surges or balks. I keep changing angles and holds in quick succession, learning what each mare obeys as the pen fights back.",

    "rightOption": "I drive into the noisiest churn of the storm, sprinting through splintering branches and sliding snow as the boar smashes ahead. I keep close enough to feel the tremor of its steps through the ground and let the chaos carry my pace.",

    "leftOption": "I narrow my pursuit to one repeatable rhythm—breath, step, spear—refusing to chase every feint. I keep refining the same pattern until my body stops arguing and my aim stays steady under the strain.",
    "rightOption": "I drop the familiar snares and stop chasing her straight, cutting a new path across broken ground to meet her on her next turn. I abandon the hunt I planned and reshape it mid-run, forcing a fresh angle the moment her pattern shifts.",

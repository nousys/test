              <p><strong>Your “passion” is a nervous system chasing a hit, dressed up for the spotlight.</strong></p>
              <p>The highs feel clean because you style them well. Up close, it’s the same pattern: spike, attach, escalate, then get restless when the room goes quiet.</p>
              <p>Attention acts like proof of life for you. When replies slow down, your brain runs scripts to force a reaction—more messaging, louder performative charm, manufactured tension, or sudden withdrawals—then you call the outcome “connection” because it sounds nicer.</p>

                <p><strong>System core: high sensitivity input, low damping.</strong></p>

                <ul class="report-bullets">
                  <li><strong>Drive:</strong> You ramp fast off social signal. Momentum spikes on attention. Quiet makes you hunt stimulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Control:</strong> Low damping means weak regulation. Structure bends under emotion. Plans change with the room.</li>
                  <li><strong>Threat sensitivity:</strong> The sensor runs high gain. Tone shifts, pauses, and micro-cues land hard and steer state early.</li>
                  <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Downshift is late. You keep reaching until the signal stabilizes or fatigue forces a stop.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Your system runs with high gain. Social cues land hard and fast, and the body reacts before the executive layer catches up, so the impulse ships first and the reasoning shows up later.</p>
                <p>There’s constant background polling for tone shifts, pauses, facial micro-cues, and status movement. That makes you sharp in a room, but it also means your internal state keeps getting tuned by external noise.</p>
                <p>Think of it like a power grid with twitchy voltage control: small fluctuations in attention create outsized swings in mood and drive, because the stabilizers are underpowered.</p>

              <p>When attention is steady, you run clean—charming and productive. When the stream thins, the system flags danger and you start “fixing” a problem that often isn’t real.</p>
              <p><strong>The loop:</strong> you create intensity, the contact spikes, the relationship hits normal rhythm, you interpret the downshift as rejection, then you test for proof and either trigger conflict or pivot to a new target.</p>

              <p>You bond fast because speed feeds your regulation. Normal mutual interest feels flat, so you reach for escalation—fate stories, instant devotion, “this changes everything” talk, and other intensity props—because a steady pace doesn’t keep your system calm.</p>
              <p>In relationships, you over-function. You track moods, adjust your personality, manage the vibe, and keep the connection supplied with stimulation; partners often read that as devotion while you’re using it to keep anxiety down.</p>
              <p>Once things settle, steadiness starts registering as lack. Then come the reassurance mechanics: extra check-ins, bait questions, jealousy pings, and small fights that force them to prove they care. Over time, they stop feeling loved and start feeling managed.</p>

Re-read tomorrow and send a shorter, cleaner version if it still stands up. If you break the hold, you reset the timer.</li>
                  <li><strong>15 minutes of no-input:</strong> Sit for 15 minutes with zero feeds—including music, messaging, and passive scrolling. The point is training your system to stay steady without external signal. The discomfort is the exercise; treat it like a rep, not a debate.</li>
                  <li><strong>One-source rule:</strong> Pick one trusted person for spirals. Use them once per incident. Stop broadcasting to five friends, random DMs, comment sections, and group chats to crowdsource regulation. If they don’t answer quickly, you wait and run the no-input block instead of escalating.</li>

            <ul class="report-bullets">
              <li><strong>Drive:</strong> You spike hard on novelty. Starts feel effortless. Output stays high while the reward is fresh.</li>

              <li><strong>Threat sensitivity:</strong> Risk signals stay low. There’s little internal alarm that says “stay and finish,” even when you’re slipping.</li>
              <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Inhibition is soft. You don’t downshift into the boring middle; you exit it. Stopping looks like “drift,” not a decision.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Novel input pays fast, then decays fast. Your brain adapts quickly, so the same task stops feeling rewarding after a short run. Social reward behaves the same way; praise works, then turns into background noise once it becomes predictable.</p>

            <p><strong>Cognitive Style: The unbound query.</strong></p>
            <p>Routines don’t bind because the control layer doesn’t enforce them when the task gets dull. Threat signals stay low, so there’s no internal pressure pushing you to stay in the boring zone. Result: you drift unless an external constraint pins you down. Bursts are easy. Slow, steady output is where you leak.</p>

            <p><strong>You call it “passion.” It’s poor emotional regulation with good lighting.</strong></p>
            <p>Your "deep feelings" are just biochemical spikes. You spike hard, then you crash. You chase people, projects, and scenes that keep your nervous system entertained because quiet feels like a threat.</p>
            <p>You need reactions to stay stable. Texts, compliments, attention, even tension, anything that proves you still exist to someone. When the signal drops, you start poking the system until it responds. Then you call that response "connection."</p>

            <p>You run constant social scanning for tone shifts, pauses, facial cues, and status changes. Your brain treats these as critical data. That makes you accurate in reading rooms. It also means your internal state keeps getting recalibrated by whatever the room gives you.</p>
            <p>In system terms, you’re a power grid with unstable voltage control. Small fluctuations trigger big swings. The drama is just a symptom of a thin regulation layer.</p>

            <p>Your core bug is treating unknown variables as fatal exceptions.</p>
            <p>You try to eliminate risk by expanding your scope indefinitely. You refuse to deploy until the output feels “safe,” ignoring the obvious fact that deployment is where the real bugs show up.</p>
            <p><strong>The Loop:</strong> set objective → run threat simulation → spot a failure point → pause to gather more data → repeat until the timeline expires.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You spend two weeks researching how to start a project, then never publish the first draft. You rewrite the plan, re-check tools, then start over on the market research, and call that progress.</p>

            <li><strong>The Preference Mandate:</strong> Once per day, state one preference and hold it after the first pushback. Pick the restaurant and keep the choice. Train your system to tolerate mild conflict without shutting down.</li>
            <li><strong>The 48-Hour Tolerance Cap:</strong> When you notice disrespect or recurring friction, take one outward action within 48 hours. Say a direct sentence or refuse the next request. Thinking about it does not count.</li>
            <li><strong>Install Hard Boundaries:</strong> Write down two non-negotiables in measurable terms and enforce them for 30 days. Example: “No work messages after 9pm.” Example: “I need 24 hours before I agree to plans.” Enforcement is the point.</li>

              <p><strong>Your “passion” is a nervous system chasing a hit, dressed up for the spotlight.</strong></p>
              <p>The highs feel clean because you style them well. Under the lighting, it’s still the same pattern: spike, attach, escalate, then get restless when the room goes quiet.</p>
              <p>Attention acts like proof of life for you. When replies slow down, your brain starts running scripts to force a reaction—more messaging, louder performative charm, manufactured tension, or sudden withdrawals—then you tag the outcome as “connection” because it sounds nicer.</p>

              <p><strong>System core: high sensitivity input, low damping.</strong></p>
              <p>Your system runs with high gain. Social cues land hard and fast, and the body reacts before the executive layer catches up, so the impulse tends to ship first and the reasoning shows up later.</p>
              <p>There’s constant background polling for tone shifts, pauses, facial micro-cues, and status movement. That makes you sharp in a room, but it also means your internal state keeps getting tuned by external noise.</p>
              <p>Think of it like a power grid with twitchy voltage control: small fluctuations in attention create outsized swings in mood and drive, because the stabilizers are underpowered.</p>

              <p>When attention is steady, you run hot and clean—charming, productive, generous, magnetic. When the stream thins, the system flags danger and you start “fixing” a problem that often isn’t real.</p>
              <p><strong>The loop:</strong> you create intensity, the contact spikes, the relationship hits normal rhythm, you interpret the downshift as rejection, then you test for proof and either trigger conflict or pivot to a new target.</p>

              <p>In relationships, you over-function. You track moods, adjust your personality, manage the vibe, and keep the connection supplied with stimulation; partners often read that as devotion while you’re using it to keep anxiety down.</p>
              <p>Once things settle, steadiness starts registering as lack. Then come the reassurance mechanics: extra check-ins, bait questions, jealousy pings, and small fights that force them to prove they care. Over time, they stop feeling loved and start feeling managed.</p>

Re-read tomorrow and send a shorter, cleaner version if it still stands up. If you break the hold, you reset the timer.</li>
                  <li><strong>15 minutes of no-input:</strong> Sit for 15 minutes with zero feeds—including music, messaging, and passive scrolling. The point is training your system to stay steady without external signal. The discomfort is the exercise; treat it like a rep, not a debate.</li>

Stop broadcasting to five friends, random DMs, comment sections, and group chats to crowdsource regulation.

            <p>The launch phase pays you early. A new project, a new person, a new routine, a new aesthetic—anything that resets the scoreboard. You get hope and early praise, then the work shows up: repeat cycles, small failures, admin, the long middle where nobody claps.

            <p><strong>System Core: Overclocked planning, weak execution output.</strong></p>
            <p>You allocate heavy computing power to threat detection and structure. High control wants clean plans. High threat wants fewer surprises. Low energy means the plan stays in your head and the calendar stays empty.</p>
            <p>You demand near-certainty before you start. Standard friction—unclear requirements, imperfect timing, a vague response—gets logged as major risk. So you stall and “tighten the plan” instead of moving.</p>
            <p><strong>Cognitive Style: Offline build.</strong></p>
            <p>You design pristine architectures in a controlled environment. You see second-order consequences that everyone else misses. That makes your advice valuable. It also makes your personal execution speed slow, because reality refuses to match your model.</p>

            <p>Your core bug is treating unknown variables as fatal exceptions.</p>
            <p>You try to eliminate risk by expanding your scope indefinitely. You refuse to deploy until the output feels “safe,” ignoring the obvious fact that deployment is where the real bugs show up.</p>
            <p><strong>The Loop:</strong> set objective → run threat simulation → spot a failure point → pause to gather more data → repeat until the timeline expires.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You spend two weeks researching how to start a project, then never publish the first draft. You rewrite the plan, re-check tools, then start over on the market research, and call that progress.</p>

            <p>You treat people like volatile systems. You run silent vetting: consistency, track record, reactions under stress, how they handle conflict. Because emotions cannot be quantified, your system flags them as operational hazards.</p>
            <p>You want a partnership that stays logical and predictable. When the dynamic requires vulnerability, your system locks up because intimacy demands uncertainty.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You can talk for hours about goals and logistics, but when someone asks, “What do you actually feel about me?” you default to analysis, jokes, or a vague answer that keeps you protected.</p>

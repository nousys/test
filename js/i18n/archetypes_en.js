              <p><strong>Your “passion” is a nervous system chasing a hit, dressed up for the spotlight.</strong></p>
              <p>The highs feel clean because you style them well. Under the lighting, it’s still the same pattern: spike, attach, escalate, then get restless when the room goes quiet.</p>
              <p>Attention acts like proof of life for you. When replies slow down, your brain starts running scripts to force a reaction—more messaging, louder performative charm, manufactured tension, or sudden withdrawals—then you tag the outcome as “connection” because it sounds nicer.</p>

              <p><strong>System core: high sensitivity input, low damping.</strong></p>
              <p>Your system runs with high gain. Social cues land hard and fast, and the body reacts before the executive layer catches up, so the impulse tends to ship first and the reasoning shows up later.</p>
              <p>There’s constant background polling for tone shifts, pauses, facial micro-cues, and status movement. That makes you sharp in a room, but it also means your internal state keeps getting tuned by external noise.</p>
              <p>Think of it like a power grid with twitchy voltage control: small fluctuations in attention create outsized swings in mood and drive, because the stabilizers are underpowered.</p>

              <p>When attention is steady, you run hot and clean—charming, productive, generous, magnetic. When the stream thins, the system flags danger and you start “fixing” a problem that often isn’t real.</p>
              <p><strong>The loop:</strong> you create intensity, the contact spikes, the relationship hits normal rhythm, you interpret the downshift as rejection, then you test for proof and either trigger conflict or pivot to a new target.</p>

              <p>In relationships, you over-function. You track moods, adjust your personality, manage the vibe, and keep the connection supplied with stimulation; partners often read that as devotion while you’re using it to keep anxiety down.</p>
              <p>Once things settle, steadiness starts registering as lack. Then come the reassurance mechanics: extra check-ins, bait questions, jealousy pings, and small fights that force them to prove they care. Over time, they stop feeling loved and start feeling managed.</p>

Re-read tomorrow and send a shorter, cleaner version if it still stands up. If you break the hold, you reset the timer.</li>
                  <li><strong>15 minutes of no-input:</strong> Sit for 15 minutes with zero feeds—including music, messaging, and passive scrolling. The point is training your system to stay steady without external signal. The discomfort is the exercise; treat it like a rep, not a debate.</li>

Stop broadcasting to five friends, random DMs, comment sections, and group chats to crowdsource regulation. If they don’t answer quickly, you wait and run the no-input block instead of escalating.</li>

            <p>The launch phase pays you early. A new project, a new person, a new routine, a new aesthetic—anything that resets the scoreboard. You get hope and early praise, then the work shows up: repeat cycles, small failures, admin, the long middle where nobody claps.

            <p>Novel input spikes reward fast, then decays fast. Your brain adapts quickly, so the same task stops paying attention-dividends after a short run. Social reward behaves the same way; praise works, then becomes background noise once it turns predictable.</p>

            <p>The brain runs edge-case sweeps to justify staying uncommitted. Browser tabs multiply and frameworks endlessly stack as your notes grow. This mimics rigor but functions entirely as a delay tactic, because action creates a public record and a public record invites feedback.</p>
            <p>“Careful” is the cover story. The real pattern is avoidance of visible error. Plans look clean on paper, and the calendar stays empty because nothing gets pushed into reality.</p>

            <p><strong>System Core: Overclocked planning, throttled execution.</strong></p>
            <p>Threat detection and structure get most of the compute. The control layer demands clean inputs while the threat sensors actively block surprises. Energy runs low once the work turns messy, so the plan remains internal and the output remains theoretical.</p>
            <p>Near-certainty becomes the launch condition. Standard friction—unclear requirements, imperfect timing, vague replies, minor ambiguity—gets logged as elevated risk. The result is predictable: more planning cycles, fewer starts.</p>
            <p><strong>Cognitive Style: Offline build.</strong></p>
            <p>Architectures are pristine in a controlled environment. Second-order effects are easy for you to see, which is why people come to you for diagnostics. Real environments refuse to match your model, so execution slows while you keep patching the spec.</p>

            <p>Your core bug is treating unknown variables as fatal exceptions.</p>
            <p>Scope expands as a defense. The spec expands and the research deepens while the “prep” keeps accumulating, and deployment keeps sliding. Most bugs only surface at runtime, and you keep refusing runtime.</p>
            <p><strong>The Loop:</strong> set objective → run threat simulation → spot a weak point → gather more data → adjust the model → repeat until the timeline expires.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Two weeks go into choosing the “right” toolchain, then the first draft never ships. The plan is endlessly rewritten and the market re-scanned until the work feels “safe,” and nothing enters the world with your name on it.</p>

            <p>People get treated like volatile systems. Vetting runs quietly in the background: consistency, history, reactions under stress, conflict behavior, follow-through. Emotions resist quantification, so the system flags them as operational hazards.</p>

        <p>Neglect triggers quiet withdrawal and mind-reading expectations. The other person won’t infer the problem, and resentment keeps stacking.</p>

            <li><strong>The 48-Hour Tolerance Cap:</strong> When disrespect or recurring friction is noticed, take one outward action within 48 hours. Say one direct sentence or refuse the next request. Thinking about it does not count.</li>
            <li><strong>Install Hard Boundaries:</strong> Write down two non-negotiables in measurable terms and enforce them for 30 days. Example: “No work messages after 9pm.” Add a second rule that forces delay, such as requiring 24 hours before agreeing to plans. Enforcement is the point.</li>

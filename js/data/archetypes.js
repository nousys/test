            <p>Your "deep feelings" are just biochemical spikes. You spike hard, then you crash. You chase people, projects, and scenes that keep your nervous system entertained because quiet feels like a threat.</p>
            <p>You need reactions to stay stable. Texts, compliments, attention, even tension, anything that proves you still exist to someone. When the signal drops, you start poking the system until it responds. Then you call that response "connection."</p>

            <p><strong>System Core: Overclocked planning, weak execution output.</strong></p>
            <p>You allocate heavy computing power to threat detection and structure. High control wants clean plans. High threat wants fewer surprises. Low energy means the plan stays in your head and the calendar stays empty.</p>
            <p>You demand near-certainty before you start. Standard friction—unclear requirements, imperfect timing, a vague response—gets logged as major risk. So you stall and “tighten the plan” instead of moving.</p>
            <p><strong>Cognitive Style: Offline build.</strong></p>
            <p>You design pristine architectures in a controlled environment. You see second-order consequences that everyone else misses. That makes your advice valuable. It also makes your personal execution speed slow, because reality refuses to match your model.</p>

            <h3 class="report-header">🌪️ THE FATAL ERROR: THE INFINITE COMPILE</h3>
            <p>Your core bug is treating unknown variables as fatal exceptions.</p>
            <p>You try to eliminate risk by expanding your scope indefinitely. You refuse to deploy until the output feels “safe,” ignoring the obvious fact that deployment is where the real bugs show up.</p>
            <p><strong>The Loop:</strong> set objective → run threat simulation → spot a failure point → pause to gather more data → repeat until the timeline expires.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You spend two weeks researching how to start a project, then never publish the first draft. You rewrite the plan, re-check tools, then start over on the market research, and call that progress.</p>

            <p>You treat people like volatile systems. You run silent vetting: consistency, track record, reactions under stress, how they handle conflict. Because emotions cannot be quantified, your system flags them as operational hazards.</p>
            <p>You want a partnership that stays logical and predictable. When the dynamic requires vulnerability, your system locks up because intimacy demands uncertainty.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You can talk for hours about goals and logistics, but when someone asks, “What do you actually feel about me?” you default to analysis, jokes, or a vague answer that keeps you protected.</p>

                <p>You aren't "invisible" because you are weak; you are invisible because you are the foundation — and foundations are rarely seen until the house crumbles.</p>
                <p>Just as Hestia quietly surrendered her golden throne to Dionysus to prevent a war on Olympus, you often step back not out of submission, but out of sovereignty. While the rest of the world is exhausting itself chasing the spotlight (<strong>High Energy</strong>) or trying to bend reality to their will (<strong>High Control</strong>), you sit in the corner — unbothered, enduring.</p>
                <p>You have realized a quiet truth: survival isn’t about how hard you can hit; it’s about how much you can absorb. You are the water flowing around the rock. The rock thinks it is strong because it is hard, but you know the truth — the water is still there a thousand years later, long after the rock has turned to sand.</p>

                <p><strong>System Core: Radical Acceptance (The Flow State).</strong></p>
                <p>You operate on the <strong>Hearth OS</strong> — a stable system built on sustainability, not stimulation. Your baseline is peace, not motion.</p>
                <p><strong>Low Energy (Conservation):</strong> You value efficiency. You don’t waste your limited heat on drama or ambition for its own sake. You are the coals, not the fireworks — quietly alive, never burning out.</p>
                <p><strong>Low Control (Fluidity):</strong> You adapt instead of forcing. When doors close, you don’t break them down — you find another entrance. Palace or storm, you find equilibrium. You don’t crack because you don’t resist.</p>
                <p><strong>Low Threat (Stoicism):</strong> You are immune to frenzy. Fear rolls off you like mist on stone. You move calmly through chaos not because of fearlessness but because of inner stillness.</p>

                <p><strong>The Bottleneck:</strong> Because you don’t demand power or recognition, others underestimate you. You’re not passive — you’re strategic with your energy. You’re simply waiting for a cause worth burning for.</p>

            <p>Your bug is <strong>Over-Endurance</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>The Shape of Water:</strong> Because you can adapt to anything, you tolerate too much. You remain in stagnant or harmful spaces not because you’re captive, but because your pain threshold is too high to feel the urgency to leave.</p>
            <p><strong>The Path of Least Resistance:</strong> You avoid friction by design. But a life without friction never ignites. You risk settling for "peaceful numbness" instead of "living meaning."</p>

                    <li><strong>Curate Your Environment:</strong> You adapt to everything — so choose your settings carefully. Don’t adapt to decay; adapt to growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Boundaries:</strong> A river without banks becomes a swamp. Define one or two sacred “No’s.” They’ll turn your calm into power.</li>

                <p>You walk through life with a silent scoreboard in your head, tracking how much <em>you</em> do versus how little <em>they</em> do. You are the "Designated Adult" in every room.

                <p>You aren’t just "organized." You are <strong>addicted to certainty</strong>. You try to pre-plan conversations, pre-feel emotions, and pre-solve problems that haven't happened yet. You call this "being prepared." Psychology calls it "High-Functioning Anxiety wearing a suit."</p>

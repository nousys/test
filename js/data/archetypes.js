            <p><strong>You call it “passion.” It’s poor emotional regulation with good lighting.</strong></p>
            <p>Your "deep feelings" are just biochemical spikes. You spike hard, then you crash. You chase people, projects, and scenes that keep your nervous system entertained because quiet feels like a threat.</p>
            <p>You need reactions to stay stable. Texts, compliments, attention, even tension—anything that proves you still exist to someone. When the signal drops, you start poking the system until it responds. Then you call that response "connection."</p>

            <p>You run constant social scanning for tone shifts, pauses, facial cues, and status changes. Your brain treats these as critical data. That makes you accurate in reading rooms. It also means your internal state keeps getting recalibrated by whatever the room gives you.</p>
            <p>In system terms, you’re a power grid with unstable voltage control. Small fluctuations trigger big swings. The drama is just a symptom of a thin regulation layer.</p>

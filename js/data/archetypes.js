                <p>You walk through life with a silent scoreboard in your head, tracking how much <em>you</em> do versus how little <em>they</em> do. You are the "Designated Adult" in every room. You secretly believe that if you stopped pushing, the entire world would grind to a halt—and the tragic part is, you’ve probably rigged your life so that’s actually true.</p>
                <p>You aren’t just "organized." You are <strong>addicted to certainty</strong>. You try to pre-plan conversations, pre-feel emotions, and pre-solve problems that haven't happened yet. You call this "being prepared." Psychology calls it "High-Functioning Anxiety wearing a suit."</p>

            <p>Your <strong>High Threat sensitivity</strong> doesn’t mean you’re paranoid—it means you’re highly reactive to social signals: tone, facial micro-shifts, rejection cues, approval, distance. You’re tuned like a professional instrument. In psychology, this often maps to <strong>high sensitivity</strong> and strong <strong>social salience detection</strong>.</p>

            <p>You metabolize life into beauty: style, story, humor, romance, art, identity. You make people feel more alive—because your emotional system gives them permission to feel. When you’re healthy, you’re not “dramatic.” You’re <strong>vivid</strong>.</p>

            <br>
            <strong>🧲 Social Magnetism</strong>
            <p>You are often unforgettable because you do what most people fear: you show emotion openly. That authenticity creates intimacy fast. People don’t just like you—they feel <em>seen</em> by you.</p>

            <li><strong>Two-Identity Rule:</strong> Separate <em>Self</em> from <em>Output</em>. Criticism of the work is not rejection of the person.</li>
            <li><strong>DBT Skill: Opposite Action:</strong> When you want to isolate, send one message. When you want to quit, do ten minutes. Tiny opposites break spirals.</li>
            <li><strong>Validation Diet:</strong> Reduce the frequency of checking external approval (social media, texts) during creative work. Your art dies when your attention becomes a begging bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotion Delay:</strong> Don’t act on peak emotion. Write the message. Save it. Re-read in 24 hours. Most disasters end here.</li>
